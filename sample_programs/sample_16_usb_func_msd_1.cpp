// USBMSD and FlashAPI sample.
// It is a sample program that can read and write serial flash from the PC via Filesystem.
// By connecting the board and the PC with a USB cable, you can refer inside the device as a mass storage device.
// (The format is required when connecting for the first time.)
// Part of the flash address is used as storage.
// The first 1MB is used as the program area, and the rest is used as the storage.
// [Attention!] Delete the "OVERRIDE_CONSOLE_USBSERIAL" macro in "mbed_app.json" file if it is set.
